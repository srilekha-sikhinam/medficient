# Project Goals
The overall goals of this project are to build a model that can predict length of stay and total costs for patients at New York hospitals at the time of their admission. This project also seeks to find if a hospital should build different models for each condition type or if one general model can suffice. Finally the output of this project is an interactive form where users can enter patient admission information and recieve a prediciton of their estimated length of stay and total cost.

# Downloading the Data
Our datafiles can be accessed at the following links: 
[Hospital Inpatient Discharges (SPARCS De-Identified): 2017](https://health.data.ny.gov/dataset/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/22g3-z7e7)
[Hospital Inpatient Discharges (SPARCS De-Identified): 2018](https://healthdata.gov/State/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/apnh-6ij9)

The datasets can also be accessed in this GoogleDrive Folder: 

Please use either of those resources to download the data files and save them to the data/raw directory.

# Data Pipeline
To run our code please run the notebook [inset notebook here]. That notebook runs our data pipeline and creates the cleaned datasets, the models, and outputs our form. This file does take some time to run. Our pipeline is as follows: [insert pipeline diagram here]

# Modeling Exploration
We have also included some notebooks to show how our team landed on our final models. These notebooks are in the notebook folder. Once the datafiles are in their correct location, these notebooks can be run as is.
